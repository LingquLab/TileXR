## Project

TileXR is a C++14 communication runtime for Huawei Ascend NPUs. It provides tile-level synchronization, optional collectives and EP libraries, IPC/MTE communication, registered-memory UDMA, and opt-in local SDMA.

- Current build target: CANN 9.1.0 and NPU driver 25.1.rc1 or later.
- Core runtime targets Ascend 910B and 910A5. UDMA data-plane validation requires A5 / Ascend950 / 950 hardware.

## Key Paths

```text
src/comm/          Core runtime and IPC, UDMA, and SDMA transports
src/collectives/   Optional collectives library
src/ep/            Optional expert-parallel dispatch/combine library
src/include/       Public host and device headers
tests/             Module, source, integration, and hardware tests
scripts/           Environment, build, test, and utility scripts
reference/         Ignored comparison-only upstream checkouts
docs/              Architecture and validation guides
```

## Build and Test

Initialize submodules and source the environment before building or testing:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
source scripts/common_env.sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/install"
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
cmake --install build
```

Optional CMake switches are `TILEXR_BUILD_COLLECTIVES`, `TILEXR_BUILD_EP`, `TILEXR_BUILD_TESTS`, and `TILEXR_BUILD_CHECKER`. Run focused tests for the changed module; use [docs/BUILD_VERIFICATION.md](docs/BUILD_VERIFICATION.md) for build and hardware validation details. The complete script catalog is in [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md).

## Continuous Improvement

- Before completing a development change, identify reusable lessons and pitfalls that are likely to matter in future work. Record them in the most relevant maintained Markdown document and include that documentation update in the same commit as the change that produced the lesson.
- Keep these notes concise, actionable, and evidence-based. Capture the triggering context, failure mode or impact, root cause, correct approach, and validation boundary; update an existing module, architecture, validation, or troubleshooting document instead of creating scattered task notes when possible.
- Add a lesson to `AGENTS.md` only when it is project-wide, high-impact, and easy to get wrong repeatedly. Keep task-specific details, transient environment observations, and long investigations in the relevant documentation instead.

## Architecture

- `src/comm` builds `libtile-comm.so`, owns communicator setup, peer mappings, capability flags, and `CommArgs`, and exposes the core API through `tilexr_api.h`.
- Device synchronization uses reusable magic-tagged flags. Use `TileXRCommNextMagic` for new rounds rather than resetting shared flag memory.
- `src/collectives` builds `libtilexr-collectives.so` when enabled. Multi-rank AllToAll requires the supported `TOPO_910_93` topology.
- `src/ep` builds standalone dispatch/combine host and kernel libraries. The peer-memory backend supports both same-node and cross-node traffic; the UDMA backend uses registered workspaces.
- UDMA is a registered remote-memory transport for A5 / Ascend950. SDMA is an opt-in same-device GM copy transport enabled with `TILEXR_ENABLE_SDMA=1`.

## Critical Constraints

- Preserve C++14 and CANN 9.1 compatibility unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Treat `reference/` as comparison-only; active targets must not include or link sources from it.
- An NPU reported in `Alarm` state may be treated as a healthy, usable card; do not exclude it solely because of the `Alarm` state.
- UDMA and SDMA are best-effort capabilities. Communicator initialization must preserve existing paths when either is unavailable.
- Do not select memory versus UDMA from topology alone: memory supports cross-node transfers. Prefer memory for small transfers and UDMA for large transfers, subject to runtime capability and registration readiness.
- `TileXRUDMARegister` is unsupported in `InitThread`; UDMA targets must be registered ordinary device memory, not `peerMems[]`.
- UDMA WQEs must be assembled entirely in UB and published to the SQ through MTE3. Never construct or patch an SQ WQE with scalar or direct-GM stores.
- Ring a UDMA doorbell only with `st_dev`, after the corresponding MTE3 WQE write has completed. Scalar stores must never be used for doorbells.
- Never put `${ASCEND_HOME_PATH}/${ARCH}-linux/devlib` in runtime RPATH/RUNPATH; runtime must resolve the real driver HAL.
- Never use Host wrappers that launch Ascend C kernels with `kernel<<<...>>>` syntax. Build and embed pure AICore binaries, register them with `rtDevBinaryRegister` and `rtFunctionRegister`, then launch the registered signature with `rtKernelLaunchWithFlagV2`.
- MoonEP source changes must preserve the API contract consumed by `tools/moonep/test_npu_e2e.py`; do not change that test's calls to accommodate an implementation change. Preserve the `Buffer` and `MoonEPCommPlan` names, method signatures and keyword arguments, return tuple arity and order, exposed plan fields, and async-event and zero-copy call contracts exercised by the test.
- Host, simulator, and 910B fallback tests do not prove UDMA data-plane transfer. Keep validation claims scoped to the hardware actually exercised.

### Communication Environment Baseline

- For communication, peer-memory, MTE, `507035`, or device-dependent failures, run the installed official HCCL Test on the same devices and topology before investigating TileXR or operator code. The test mode must exercise the failing data path; use `all_reduce_test -a aiv_only` for AIV-only peer-memory cases.
- Treat the matching HCCL Test as the environment-health baseline, judging it by per-rank correctness output rather than exit status alone; operation failures may still exit with code 0.
- A pass on a different device subset, topology, or accelerator mode does not validate the failing path. If the matching HCCL Test also fails, classify the environment or platform baseline as unhealthy, preserve the bounded logs, stop operator-side debugging, and ask the user to provide a repaired or new known-good environment before continuing. Do not modify TileXR code to work around an unproven environment failure.
